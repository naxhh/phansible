[Phansible](http://phansible.com) is a simple generator for Vagrant projects, targeting PHP development environments, using Ansible as Provisioner.

It was inspired by [PuPHPet](http://puphpet.com).

The project is built on top of [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), using [Flint](http://flint.readthedocs.org/).

## Setup

- Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/Phansible/phansible.git```
- Go into the phansible folder ```cd phansible/```
- Install the dependencies with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/): ```php composer install```
- Run the php built in server: ```php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t web/```
